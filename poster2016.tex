\Large Our research examines the statistical behaviour of escaping pedestrians 
when two contiguous exits are available, but placed at different separation 
distances. We found that the evacuation time can be improved if the separation 
exceeds a threshold distance. This threshold distance is related to changes in 
the clogging dynamics close to the doors.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\Large 

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textcolor{blue}{\checkmark}] Short separation distances (Gap $\simeq1.2$ m) worsen the evacuation performance for all the explored situations, 
while larger distances (Gap $>1.2\,$m) enhances the evacuation time for 
relatively small crowds and moderate anxiety levels.
\item[\textcolor{blue}{\checkmark}]As the separation distance approaches 
$1.2\,$m (from the null distance), the probability of having blocking 
structures around each door raises, resembling the situation of two independent 
doors.
\item[\textcolor{blue}{\checkmark}] Increasing the crowd size ($N$) or the 
pedestrian's anxiety level ($v_d$) slows down the evacuation. Both magnitudes 
raise the pressure acting on the pedestrians.
\end{itemize}
